Dear All,

Kindly share your comments regarding the user stories here!

Mr. Shabeer, 
I have gone through the user stories and they looked perfect. However, there might be some needs for changes i believe. if you dont mind

in the first user story:
since it is an English to Dari dictionary, most of the cs terminologies cannot directly be traslated to Dari. So i think it wont work that way.

in the seventh user story:
though the priority is low, but it still wont be possible to develop such dictionary to have millions of words. for this project, i think it would be better to go with 100 words maximam.

in the 10th user story:
it is good to have synonyms, antonyms, and examples. But instead of writing "for the searched word", i think it would be better to use "for complicated words", because there are some words 
which does not have any synonyms and antonyms.

... and can we have an option for rating the dictionary by the users too?!
